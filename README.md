In order to organize data, we are leveraging AI (neural networks) along with some manual intervention to create one of the best softwares that can help one arrange their images in a way that makes sense. This will ensure searching similar images from the entire database or based on specific keywords.

We are planning to implement the following as a part of our app. We will ensure a modular approach to make the main part of our app first to ensure the base of the idea and later implement the UI part. We will be implementing the following modules in order :

- Module to extract image and description features
- Module to search an image using an image
- Module to search an image using text/ description
- Database to store the image feature and text metadata
- Integration of above modules with an interface
